        <p>
          I have worked to overcome obstacles to become a full stack developer
          graduating from University of Utahâ€™s boot camp near the top of the
          class, earning me a full-stack developer certificate with a background
          in Industrial/Organizational Psychology. I have studied diligently to
          learn and implement React, Redux, and GraphQL. I implemented all three
          of these in a project called Rolodeck where I worked with a team and
          implemented GraphQL for the entire project, programmed a QR scanner in
          React, and implemented Redux for easily transferable data.
